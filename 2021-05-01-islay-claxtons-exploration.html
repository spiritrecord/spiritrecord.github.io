    <h2>Islay 2012 Claxton's Exploration 8 years 50% (refill sherry butt)</h2>
    <p>The final Claxton’s Exploration I’ll be looking at for now. We’ve got another blended malt – presumably teaspooned. Coordinates are 55.63N, 6.15W. This one leads to a quite legendary south coast Islay distillery. Thoughts on the bottling series itself also after the fold.</p>

<p><strong>Colour</strong> Straw.</p>

<p><strong>Nose</strong> Peat. Intensely herbal and medicinal. Fire and sand. Seaweed and salt. Heavy, sticky, orange almond cake. Minerally and coastal malt, salty. A little woody, but fresh. Plum sauce and wine gummies (hello cask?). Some pepper and menthol.</p>

<p><strong>Palate</strong> Thick, oily and medicinal – almost bitter (this is a pleasant thing). Moss, smoke: peat. South coast in character. Scotch fingers and grain – malt. Black tea. Some sweetness, and a fruity, berry note. Like a handful of blueberries and raspberries. Cream. Interesting contrasts here. Back to grassy and herbal.</p>

<p><strong>Finish</strong> Oil and smoke. Cough syrup, but the sweetness isn’t artificial. Varnish. Bready. A touch of olive oil. Moderate, but the peat does power on. And isn’t that what we signed up for?</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong> Classic south coast Islay style. Through the peat it does strike me as a lighter malt. I’m very much enjoying the fresh woodsy notes: herbs, grass. It’s a bit like a forest meeting the coast. 85/100.</p>

<p>All in all, Claxton’s Exploration series is probably my favourite entry level IB lineup. I’m impressed by both the quality and value of these bottlings. I strongly recommend checking it out.</p>
