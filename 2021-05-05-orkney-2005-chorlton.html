    <h2>Orkney 2005 Chorlton 15 years 57.1% (refill bourbon hogshead, apparently)</h2>
    <p>A lot of secret Orkney casks lately. No surprises: Highland Park! Are they having a sale or something? And what’s with this cask? Tasted virtually with David Bennett (Chorlton) and the Whisky and Alement team.</p>

<p>More Chorlton trivia: apparently a lot of his casks are now held at Dalswinton Bond, a dunnage warehouse. Smells good, I imagine.</p>

<p><strong>Colour</strong> Dark gold, ruby.</p>

<p><strong>Nose</strong> Wow. Exbourbon? No way. Sautéed mushrooms and soy sauce. Really quite thick, brothy, fatty. Stinky cheese. Balsamic vinegar – woody sweetness and acidity together. Salt and vinegar chips. Tart apples.</p>

<p><strong>Palate</strong> Malty. A big whack of red fruits, berries. Syrupy dried fruits and apricot delight. It’s a bit like a sherry cask. Slightly medicinal peat. Very herbal. We’ve added a bit too much cinnamon to our milk. Thick.</p>

<p><strong>Finish</strong> Medicinal peaty finish. Heavy. Off-profile for a Highland Park. Probably why it was independently bottled. Smoke. Coastal saltiness. Tamari almonds. Mushrooms and soy sauce again.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong> Completely mental. Big, heavy, coastal malt. Clarity of the umami notes are a highlight. If you told me this was an Islay, maybe refill sherry, I’d believe you. Completely off-profile for both the (ostensible) cask and the distillery. 90/100.</p>
