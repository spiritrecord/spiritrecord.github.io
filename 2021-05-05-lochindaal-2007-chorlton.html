    <h2>Lochindaal (Bruichladdich) 2007 Chorlton 12 years 61.9% (bourbon barrel)</h2>
    <p>Lochindaal was a peated spirit made by Bruichladdich shortly after they opened. More heavily peated than Port Charlotte. David says that it’s more like a peated Laddie spirit – it’s got that clarity we’d associate with it. I agree with him. Unfortunately, Bruichladdich is no longer making Lochindaal. Perhaps not a lost distillery, but a lost malt! Tasted virtually with David Bennett (Chorlton) and the Whisky and Alement team.</p>

<p>More Chorlton trivia: David runs the thing by himself, and got started by running his own tastings in Chorlton, Manchester. Then he bottled some cask ends, and the rest is history.</p>

<p><strong>Colour</strong> Gold.</p>

<p><strong>Nose</strong> Vanilla custard. Medicinal – elevated cough syrup. Umami: meaty and mushroomy. Seaweed and seawater near the beach. Very clean, austere spirit, very much akin to regular Bruichladdich. Fennel and aniseed. Honeyed and floral. A small yeasty, lactic, funky note. Salty.</p>

<p><strong>Palate</strong> Deeply medicinal. Definitely elevated cough syrup. Syrupy in texture too, thick. Earthy, woody peat. Raspberry jellies, strawberries and cream. Jam and scones. Honey and fennel, carrying with it some ginger. A little acidity, lime juice. Herbal malt. Some citrus peel – don’t forget the pith. Oily. Smoke – and quite a lot of it at the tail end, leading into the finish.</p>

<p><strong>Finish</strong> Mouth-filling smoke. It’s got volume. Very long. Warming. Ashy and earthy. Creamy. Tropical fruits: mangoes and bananas. Ice cream sundae. Very clear. Full, powerful.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong> Creamy, smoky, medicinal spirit with a keen edge. Swims well. The bones are Bruichladdich. I simply cannot say anything bad about this malt. 92/100.</p>
