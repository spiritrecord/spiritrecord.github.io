    <h2><a href="/2021-05-06-ben-nevis-2015-carn-mor.html">Ben Nevis 2015 Càrn Mòr 4 years 47.5% (sherry hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Ben Nevis again! This time another youngster. A vatting of two casks, presumably both sherry hogsheads. Weirdly high outturn of bottles though, 900 bottles. Aren’t hogsheads around 250 litres? Even assuming zero angel’s share…</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-05-06-tobermory-1995-hidden-spirits.html">Tobermory "Ledaig Unpeated" 1995 Hidden Spirits 25 years 50.2% (refill exbourbon hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Tobermory… tick… Hidden Spirits… tick. Wait. “Ledaig Unpeated”? Shouldn’t Ledaig be “Tobermory Peated” if anything? <a href="https://thelondonwhiskyclub.com/events/2021/hidden-spirits/">According to Andrea</a> (London Whisky Club) of Hidden Spirits, this might have been a cleaning run through the stills after a run of peated spirit. Apparently Ledaig was less peated back then, this this could easily be confused with the cleaning run. Anyway, Ledaigamory.</p>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-06-oloroso-north-star-series-12.html">Montilla Oloroso NV North Star 16.9% (Scotch cask)</a></h2>
    <p>Ever wonder what happens to the sherry used to season your cask? Usually it’s poured down a drain, but North Star bottled this one. Although it’s not technically sherry because it was made in Montilla. Anyway: from what I gather, used to season a barrel that once held whisky. So think of it as Scotch finished oloroso, not oloroso finished Scotch.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-05-ledaig-2010-chorlton.html">Ledaig 2010 Chorlton 10 years 57% (bourbon barrel)</a></h2>
    <p>Final dram of the Chorlton night. Ledaig, of Tobermory fame. Or should that be Tobermory, of Ledaig fame? Anyway, absolute heavyweight. Tasted virtually with David Bennett (Chorlton) and the Whisky and Alement team.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-05-lochindaal-2007-chorlton.html">Lochindaal (Bruichladdich) 2007 Chorlton 12 years 61.9% (bourbon barrel)</a></h2>
    <p>Lochindaal was a peated spirit made by Bruichladdich shortly after they opened. More heavily peated than Port Charlotte. David says that it’s more like a peated Laddie spirit – it’s got that clarity we’d associate with it. I agree with him. Unfortunately, Bruichladdich is no longer making Lochindaal. Perhaps not a lost distillery, but a lost malt! Tasted virtually with David Bennett (Chorlton) and the Whisky and Alement team.</p>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-05-orkney-2005-chorlton.html">Orkney 2005 Chorlton 15 years 57.1% (refill bourbon hogshead, apparently)</a></h2>
    <p>A lot of secret Orkney casks lately. No surprises: Highland Park! Are they having a sale or something? And what’s with this cask? Tasted virtually with David Bennett (Chorlton) and the Whisky and Alement team.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-05-bunnahabhain-2002-chorlton.html">Bunnahabhain 2002 Chorlton 18 years 53.4% (sherry butt)</a></h2>
    <p>A Christmas release for Chorlton. Apt. Sherry, but the complete opposite of a sherry bomb. Tasted virtually with David Bennett (Chorlton) and the Whisky and Alement team.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-05-glenlossie-1992-chorlton.html">Glenlossie 1992 Chorlton 27 years 51.2% (hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Early 90s Glenlossie. Reportedly (from David) amazing, underrated, the golden years. Also, I’m told, needs this kind of age. Tasted virtually with David Bennett (Chorlton) and the Whisky and Alement team.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-05-croftengea-2007-chorlton.html">Croftengea (Loch Lomond) 2007 Chorlton 13 years 53.9% (hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Croftengea is one of Loch Lomond’s many spirit profiles. Heavily peated. This one, not so much. Tasted virtually with David Bennett (Chorlton) and the Whisky and Alement team. First cab off the rank.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-04-longmorn-2002-lmdw.html">Longmorn 2002 "The Ten" LMDW/Signatory Vintage 40.1%</a></h2>
    <p>Apparently bottled by Signatory Vintage for La Maison du Whisky as part of “The Ten” series. Label reads: “A distinctive range of 10 young Scotch Whiskies profiling classic characteristics”. Intro range? Anyway, this is Profile #4, “Medium Speyside”. Not sure if Medium is apt…</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-04-glen-elgin-2004-lotg.html">Glen Elgin 2004 Lady of the Glen 16 years 51.3% (Rivesaltes finish)</a></h2>
    <p>Fifteen years in a hogshead, finished in a Rivesaltes cask and then charged into a rather attractive bottle. Rivesaltes is a French sweet fortified. And that cask did a number on this one.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-04-dailuaine-2007-provenance.html">Dailuaine 2007 Douglas Laing's Provenance 9 years 46% (sherry butt)</a></h2>
    <p>Kind of obscure Diageo malt, which means they’ve got a Flora and Fauna bottle. Instead of a cute animal this one is from Douglas Laing’s Provenance lineup and was aged in a sherry butt.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-04-blue-hanger-11th.html">Blue Hanger "11th Limited Release" Berry Bros. & Rudd 45.6%</a></h2>
    <p>Berry Bros. &amp; Rudd’s blended malt whisky. Unknown to me before I tasted: apparently 8 casks in this blend, 4 hoggies, 3 sherry butts. Peated and unpeated Bunnahabhain. Glad to know I wasn’t going insane tasting peat and dried fruits.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-03-tobermory-12-manzanilla.html">Tobermory "Manzanilla Finish" 12 years 46.3% (exbourbon and manzanilla)</a></h2>
    <p>Official bottling from Tobermory. From what I gather, spent ten years in exbourbon casks and two in manzanilla casks. For those playing at home, manzanilla is a dry sherry similar to a fino, known for its freshness and salinity. Unusual, as most sherry casks used for whisky are oloroso or PX.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-03-deanston-2009-rbt.html">Deanston 2009 Rest & Be Thankful 10 years 57.1% (exbourbon)</a></h2>
    <p>Here’s a recent bottle from Rest &amp; Be Thankful (great story behind that name). I’m personally enjoying what Deanston has to offer these days. Read on if you like oranges.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-03-caol-ila-18-unpeated-2017.html">Caol Ila "Unpeated Style" 18 years 59.8% (refill exbourbon hogsheads)</a></h2>
    <p>Picture this: Caol Ila. Now remove the peat. Hard, no? Let’s see. This one was bottled in 2017 for Diageo’s special releases.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-03-ben-nevis-1996-twa.html">Ben Nevis 1996 The Whisky Agency 23 years 47.6% (hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Back to back Ben Nevis. This time from The Whisky Agency. Presumably a sherry hogshead, but not specified beyond cask size.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-03-ben-nevis-1996-thompson-bros.html">Ben Nevis 1996 Thompson Bros. 22 years 44.4% (refill sherry butt)</a></h2>
    <p>From cult indie bottler comes a cult distillery in a cult cask. At a cult price too!</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-02-teaninich-2006-hidden-spirits.html">Teaninich 2006 Hidden Spirits 13 years 51.7% (exbourbon)</a></h2>
    <p>Another Hidden Spirit, this time from Teaninich. Not quite as obscure as Balmenach, but not exactly hyped… hope you like salad.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-02-springbank-12-cs.html">Springbank "Cask Strength" 12 years 55.3% (2020)</a></h2>
    <p>The 2020 release of Springbank’s cask strength 12 year old. From what I gather, it’s 35 per cent sherry and 65 per cent exbourbon.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-02-glenrothes-2006-wilson-morgan.html">Glenrothes 2006 Wilson and Morgan 48% (first fill sherry butts)</a></h2>
    <p>A vatting of three casks. First fill sherry butts.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-02-blair-athol-2003-dod.html">Blair Athol 2003 Douglas of Drumlanrig 12 years 46% (refill hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Presumably an exbourbon refill hoggy. One of Diageo’s blend focused distilleries.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-02-ben-nevis-2015-adelphi.html">Ben Nevis 2015 Adelphi 5 years 61.3% (first fill sherry)</a></h2>
    <p>Adelphi! I got the email for this outturn at ten in the morning, I believe. Three minutes later, this was sold out (alongside most of the other bottles in this outturn). Oh well, c’est la vie. The people love the colour. Judging by the number of bottles (622), probably a sherry butt.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-02-balmenach-2004-hidden-spirits.html">Balmenach 2004 Hidden Spirits 13 years 51.2% (exbourbon)</a></h2>
    <p>An honest little exbourbon malt from Hidden Spirits, one of my favourite bottlers. From a rather obscure distillery.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-01-secret-highland-claxtons-exploration.html">Secret Highland 2010 Claxton's Exploration 10 years 50% (tawny port butt)</a></h2>
    <p>Another Claxton’s Exploration bottling. This time a secret highland. Coordinates are 58.02N, 3.87W.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-01-islay-claxtons-exploration.html">Islay 2012 Claxton's Exploration 8 years 50% (refill sherry butt)</a></h2>
    <p>The final Claxton’s Exploration I’ll be looking at for now. We’ve got another blended malt – presumably teaspooned. Coordinates are 55.63N, 6.15W. This one leads to a quite legendary south coast Islay distillery. Thoughts on the bottling series itself also after the fold.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-01-ardmore-claxtons-exploration.html">Ardmore 2009 Claxton's Exploration 11 years 50% (refill PX hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Continuing on our Claxton’s Exploration. We’ve got an Ardmore – single malt, very much disclosed distillery. There’s no mystery this time, but the coordinates are 57.35N, 2.74W.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-04-30-campbeltown-claxtons-exploration.html">Campbeltown Blend 2015 Claxton's Exploration 5 years 50% (PX hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Part of the inaugural outturn of Claxton’s Exploration series comes a blended malt from Campbeltown. As I understand it, this is a teaspooned malt. It spent only five years in a PX hogshead.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-04-30-bruichladdich-ternary.html">Bruichladdich "The Ternary Project" 52.1%</a></h2>
    <p>Bruichladdich’s March (April, really) ballot bottle, capping off the Valinch ballots due to the distillery’s COVID closure. The pricing on this one caused quite a stir round the whisky groups. I think price expectations were much lower for the ballot and Bruichladdich might have been better served with this as a Fèis Ìle bottle. That said, if you’re willing to buy Black Art, you should probably be willing to buy this. And wow – does it deliver.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-04-29-springbank-longrow-north-star.html">Springbank (Longrow) 1994 North Star 25 years 48.5% (refill exbourbon hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Part of North Star’s recent Springbank lineup. Labelled as Springbank, peated and double distilled. Both Springbank and North Star are highly respected and popular, so as expected, it flew off the shelves…</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-04-29-secret-highland-hand-in-hand-3rd-release.html">Secret Highland 2010 Hand-in-Hand 10 years 52.4% (refill exbourbon hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Bottled by a triumvirate of Australian whisky institutions: Whisky and Alement, the Oak Barrel, and Casa de Vinos. Titled “Bees &amp; Fruit Trees” with a cheeky wax-on-wax-off reference label by Blake Wilson. Thoughts jump (like a cat) to mind of a distillery associated with wax…</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-04-29-arran-viognier-tfr.html">Arran 2013 Fisherman's Retreat 7 years 50% (Yalumba Viognier cask)</a></h2>
    <p>A cask you don’t see every day. Distilled by Arran and put into a Viognier cask from Yalumba (South Australia). Bottled by the Fisherman’s Retreat as part of their limited edition series. I do have the cask strength bottling, but today I’m looking at the 50%.</p>

    <p>Another Linkwood.</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-04-28-linkwood-2007-hidden-spirits.html">Linkwood 2007 Hidden Spirits 13 years 54.1% (refill exbourbon hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Linkwood is a distillery you don’t see often bottled by Diageo themselves. Fortunately it is a relatively common malt among independent bottlers. Here we’ve got one from Hidden Spirits, a small Italian independent bottler.</p>
