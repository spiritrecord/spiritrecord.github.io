    <p>Another Hidden Spirit, this time from Teaninich. Not quite as obscure as Balmenach, but not exactly hyped… hope you like salad.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-05-02-springbank-12-cs.html">Springbank "Cask Strength" 12 years 55.3% (2020)</a></h2>
    <p>The 2020 release of Springbank’s cask strength 12 year old. From what I gather, it’s 35 per cent sherry and 65 per cent exbourbon.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-05-02-glenrothes-2006-wilson-morgan.html">Glenrothes 2006 Wilson and Morgan 48% (first fill sherry butts)</a></h2>
    <p>A vatting of three casks. First fill sherry butts.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-05-02-blair-athol-2003-dod.html">Blair Athol 2003 Douglas of Drumlanrig 12 years 46% (refill hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Presumably an exbourbon refill hoggy. One of Diageo’s blend focused distilleries.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-05-02-ben-nevis-2015-adelphi.html">Ben Nevis 2015 Adelphi 5 years 61.3% (first fill sherry)</a></h2>
    <p>Adelphi! I got the email for this outturn at ten in the morning, I believe. Three minutes later, this was sold out (alongside most of the other bottles in this outturn). Oh well, c’est la vie. The people love the colour. Judging by the number of bottles (622), probably a sherry butt.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-05-02-balmenach-2004-hidden-spirits.html">Balmenach 2004 Hidden Spirits 13 years 51.2% (exbourbon)</a></h2>
    <p>An honest little exbourbon malt from Hidden Spirits, one of my favourite bottlers. From a rather obscure distillery.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-05-01-secret-highland-claxtons-exploration.html">Secret Highland 2010 Claxton's Exploration 10 years 50% (tawny port butt)</a></h2>
    <p>Another Claxton’s Exploration bottling. This time a secret highland. Coordinates are 58.02N, 3.87W.</p>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-05-01-islay-claxtons-exploration.html">Islay 2012 Claxton's Exploration 8 years 50% (refill sherry butt)</a></h2>
    <p>The final Claxton’s Exploration I’ll be looking at for now. We’ve got another blended malt – presumably teaspooned. Coordinates are 55.63N, 6.15W. This one leads to a quite legendary south coast Islay distillery. Thoughts on the bottling series itself also after the fold.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-05-01-ardmore-claxtons-exploration.html">Ardmore 2009 Claxton's Exploration 11 years 50% (refill PX hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Continuing on our Claxton’s Exploration. We’ve got an Ardmore – single malt, very much disclosed distillery. There’s no mystery this time, but the coordinates are 57.35N, 2.74W.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-04-30-campbeltown-claxtons-exploration.html">Campbeltown Blend 2015 Claxton's Exploration 5 years 50% (PX hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Part of the inaugural outturn of Claxton’s Exploration series comes a blended malt from Campbeltown. As I understand it, this is a teaspooned malt. It spent only five years in a PX hogshead.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-04-30-bruichladdich-ternary.html">Bruichladdich "The Ternary Project" 52.1%</a></h2>
    <p>Bruichladdich’s March (April, really) ballot bottle, capping off the Valinch ballots due to the distillery’s COVID closure. The pricing on this one caused quite a stir round the whisky groups. I think price expectations were much lower for the ballot and Bruichladdich might have been better served with this as a Fèis Ìle bottle. That said, if you’re willing to buy Black Art, you should probably be willing to buy this. And wow – does it deliver.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-04-29-springbank-longrow-north-star.html">Springbank (Longrow) 1994 North Star 25 years 48.5% (refill exbourbon hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Part of North Star’s recent Springbank lineup. Labelled as Springbank, peated and double distilled. Both Springbank and North Star are highly respected and popular, so as expected, it flew off the shelves…</p>

</article>

<article>
    <h2><a href="/2021-04-29-secret-highland-hand-in-hand-3rd-release.html">Secret Highland 2010 Hand-in-Hand 10 years 52.4% (refill exbourbon hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Bottled by a triumvirate of Australian whisky institutions: Whisky and Alement, the Oak Barrel, and Casa de Vinos. Titled “Bees &amp; Fruit Trees” with a cheeky wax-on-wax-off reference label by Blake Wilson. Thoughts jump (like a cat) to mind of a distillery associated with wax…</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-04-29-arran-viognier-tfr.html">Arran 2013 Fisherman's Retreat 7 years 50% (Yalumba Viognier cask)</a></h2>
    <p>A cask you don’t see every day. Distilled by Arran and put into a Viognier cask from Yalumba (South Australia). Bottled by the Fisherman’s Retreat as part of their limited edition series. I do have the cask strength bottling, but today I’m looking at the 50%.</p>

    <p>Another Linkwood.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2021-04-28-linkwood-2007-hidden-spirits.html">Linkwood 2007 Hidden Spirits 13 years 54.1% (refill exbourbon hogshead)</a></h2>
    <p>Linkwood is a distillery you don’t see often bottled by Diageo themselves. Fortunately it is a relatively common malt among independent bottlers. Here we’ve got one from Hidden Spirits, a small Italian independent bottler.</p>
