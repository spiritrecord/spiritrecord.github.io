<p>Berry Bros. &amp; Rudd’s blended malt whisky. Unknown to me before I tasted: apparently 8 casks in this blend, 4 hoggies, 3 sherry butts. Peated and unpeated Bunnahabhain.</p>

<p><strong>Colour</strong> Light gold.</p>

<p><strong>Nose</strong> Pleasingly rubbery, almost Springbank-like. A little peat. Malt-forward, bready. Juicy peaches and pawpaw. Chocolate sundae. Some dried fruits and a hint of oak. Scotch fingers with a gingerbread twist. There’s that little peatsmoke note!</p>

<p><strong>Palate</strong> Lighter than expected. A little watery. Malt-forward again, some oak astringency, but quite pleasing. Oak spices. Some brightness, perhaps lemons or a cider. Tea and sugar.</p>

<p><strong>Finish</strong> A very light rubbery peat and fresh grapes. Drying as I write into sultanas and raisins. Via the smoke? Chocolate. Malty and buttery. Butter on toast. A little melon candy. Moderate to long.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong> Terrific nose and pleasing finish, but the palate lets it down. A little watery and simple for my liking. Hollow on the inside. The peat notes are lovely, as are the dried fruits. 77/100.</p>
